	abstract = {We design novel, asymptotically more efficient data structures
	            and algorithms for programs whose data access patterns exhibit
	            some degree of predictability. To this end, we propose two novel
	            techniques, a pointer-based technique and a locality-based
	            technique. We show that these two techniques are powerful
	            building blocks in making data structures and algorithms
	            oblivious. Specifically, we apply these techniques to a broad
	            range of commonly used data structures, including maps, sets,
	            priority-queues, stacks, deques; and algorithms, including a
	            memory allocator algorithm, max-flow on graphs with low doubling
	            dimension, and shortest-path distance queries on weighted planar
	            graphs. Our oblivious counterparts of the above outperform the
	            best known ORAM scheme both asymptotically and in practice.},
