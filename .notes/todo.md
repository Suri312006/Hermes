# todo

## main
-[ ] implement the OMAP for the user store
-[ ] Nice documentation for everything
-[ ] figure out how adding a user works (OMAP semantics)


## expansion
-[ ] client side implementation with sqlite?
-[ ] figure out how to get this building on fortranix sgx


sgx feature

when enabled, compiles for sgx using enclave runner
otherwise just runs inside

could sell it as like ok i dont have the hardware for this yet so im kinda cringing


inspired by how groovy had the provider system

to make sparta-ll into a provider based system, its fairly cheap to have a small
embedded device to act as a proxy for each user its not super unfeasable
